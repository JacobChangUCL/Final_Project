His left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now with both joints affected, he has difficulty walking and feels frustrated. He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest. He also suffers from dandruff for which he uses special shampoos. Physical examination is notable for pitting of his nails. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?', 'A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?', 'A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?', 'A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of pallor and increasing lethargy for 2 days. One week ago, he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that have since subsided. The patient\\'s father states that they returned early from a 6-week roadtrip in Mexico because of these symptoms. His parents have been giving him oral rehydration solution. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears pale. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 35/min, and blood pressure is 95/50 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.
